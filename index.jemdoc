== Biography
Welcome to the academic page of Wensheng Cheng.
\n My profile: [https://spritea.github.io/jemdoc/files/resume_cws.pdf resume], [https://spritea.github.io/jemdoc/files/undergraduate.pdf undergraduate transcript], [https://spritea.github.io/jemdoc/files/master.pdf master transcript].
\n\n I am currently a final year (Sep 2019 - June 2020) Master of Science in Engineering student in the [http://eis.whu.edu.cn/indexone.shtml School of Electronic Information] of [https://en.whu.edu.cn/ Wuhan University] (GPA: 4.0\/4.0), a top 10 university of China ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_University Wiki]). I am expected to graduate in June, 2020. I major in Information and Communication Engineering. I am supervised by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=-aVL-UQAAAAJ Prof. Wen Yang]. I also received the B. Eng degree from the School of Electronic Information in Wuhan University in 2017 (grades:87.89\/100, rank: 4th\/120).
\n\n My research lies at image analysis, especially aerial imagery. I also have experience in robertics vision, including UAV and robocar application. Recently, I am working on semantic segmentation methods for remote sensing imagery analysis. I also have interest in sharing projects and I am one of the main contributors of open source semantic sgmentation benchmark-[https://github.com/GeorgeSeif/Semantic-Segmentation-Suite semantic segmentation suite]. This is one of the most popular semantic segmentation project on GitHub with over *1,900 stars*.
\n\n I plan to continue my academic career and look for a Ph.D position starting in Fall, 2020. If you are interestd, welcome to contact me.
